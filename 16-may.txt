Custom fields facilitate users to add additional metadata content for each data object. 
OvalEdge default provides a list of standard fields like minimum/maximum count, 
density, null density, distinct count, etc. However, users can create additional custom 
fields such as the median, sum, etc. to add more information about the data using the 
custom field module.
